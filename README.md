# GuardTracker
GuardTracker Android App repository
This repository stores the solution for the Guard Tracker Android App. The App was tested in a device with Android 6.0.
This Android App is a complement to an hardware device. 
From this App, the user may configure and monitorize any number of hardware devices with a BLE connection.
The SMS alerts generated from hardware device sent to mobile phone where this App is installed are process from this App.
The author of this App is a newber in the Android world, so some options of solution are not the best. I would like to think that each new version is committed, refactoring components of the solution are also committed.
